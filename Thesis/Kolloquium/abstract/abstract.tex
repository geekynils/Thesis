\maketitle 
Complex fluid dynamic simulations often require the tracking of particles. For example when simulating sprays for direct fuel injection into a combustion engine or for a simulation coupling the the probability density function (PDF) method with the finite volume (FV) method. A practical fluid simulation needs to handle arbitrary geometries imported from a computer aided design (CAD) system. It therefore needs to support meshes with unstructured polyhedras.  Based on existing algorithms an efficient particle engine for large number of particles is beeing developed. In order to speed up the algorithms a graphics processing unit (GPU) is used which can process hundreds of particles in parallel.
